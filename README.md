# mendelbrot_ppm_maker
The purpose of this project is to play with code that makes a Mendelbrot set and to parallelize it.

The solution works. There is not human input required, so it is not prone operator input error.
It creates a .ppm file that can be opened using Gimp 2. I used this to export a result .png file.

Ultimately, this code is used to tinker with so that I can understand better how the Mandelbrot set works.

I tested in a Windows 10 environment using CLion, Cygwin, and C11.
